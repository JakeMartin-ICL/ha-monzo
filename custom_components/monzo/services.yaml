# Service ID
pot_transfer:
  # If the service accepts entity IDs, target allows the user to specify entities by
  # entity, device, or area. If `target` is specified, `entity_id` should not be
  # defined in the `fields` map. By default it shows only targets matching entities
  # from the same domain as the service, but if further customization is required,
  # target supports the entity, device, and area selectors
  # (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/). Entity selector
  # parameters will automatically be applied to device and area, and device selector
  # parameters will automatically be applied to area.
